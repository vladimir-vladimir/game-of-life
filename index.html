      <p><b>Introduction:&nbsp;</b>Game of Life is a is a cellular automaton played on a 2D grid. The rules of the game are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
        <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
        <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
        <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The initial configuration of the board is set by the player. Afterward, at each cycle, the aforementioned rules are applied simultaneously to the entire 2D grid.</p>
